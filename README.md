# Resume-and-Past-Projects
Just as the title says, this repository is to showcase some of the work and projects I have done! Keep in mind that some of the projects may be in progress or have not been updated in a while. <br>
I have many course work projects as well, but I am unable to post them publicly to github for academic integrity. If you would like to view my course projects in machine learning, cyber security, algorithms, optimization, and more, feel free to reach out to me at willizhe@umich.edu. <br>
Public projects and the links to their respective repositories are listed  below.

### NEAT_DEMO

In this project, I wanted to invesitgate how to "evolve" Neural Networks. In particular, I was inspired by SethBling's video on using neural networks to play <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv6UVOQ0F44"> Super Mario World</a>. The research on  Neural Evolution of Augmented Topologies, was very similar to what I had in mind. In this, I tested if neural network evolution can be used for some of the challenges in Gymnasium, such as cart-pole balancing. 

### Simple-Neural-Network

During my sophmore year, I saw a video done by 3Blue1Brown on how neural network works. This project was for me to gain a better understanding of the basics. I implemented backpropogation and forward propogation by hand. The NN structure was hand coded.
